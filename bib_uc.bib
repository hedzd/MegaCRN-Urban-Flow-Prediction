	abstract = {Traffic forecasting as a canonical task of multivariate time series forecasting has been a significant research topic in AI community. To address the spatio-temporal heterogeneity and non-stationarity implied in the traffic stream, in this study, we propose Spatio-Temporal Meta-Graph Learning as a novel Graph Structure Learning mechanism on spatiotemporal data. Specifically, we implement this idea into Meta-Graph Convolutional Recurrent Network (MegaCRN) by plugging the Meta-Graph Learner powered by a MetaNode Bank into GCRN encoder-decoder. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation on two benchmark datasets (i.e., METR-LA and PEMS-BAY) and a new large-scale traffic speed dataset called EXPY-TKY that covers 1843 expressway road links in Tokyo. Our model outperformed the stateof-the-arts on all three datasets. Besides, through a series of qualitative evaluations, we demonstrate that our model can explicitly disentangle the road links and time slots with different patterns and be robustly adaptive to any anomalous traffic situations.

	abstract = {In this paper, we have proposed STC-GEF, a novel Spatio-Temporal Cross-platform Graph Embedding Fusion approach for the urban traffic flow prediction. We have designed a spatial embedding module based on graph convolutional networks (GCN) to extract the complex spatial features within traffic flow data. Furthermore, to capture the temporal dependencies between the traffic flow data from various time intervals, we have designed a temporal embedding module based on recurrent neural networks. Based on the observations that different transportation platforms trip data (e.g., taxis, Uber, and Lyft) can be correlated, we have designed an effective fusion mechanism that combines the trip data from different transportation platforms and further uses them for cross-platform traffic flow prediction (e.g., integrating taxis and ride-sharing platforms for taxi traffic flow prediction). We have conducted extensive real-world experimental studies based on real-world trip data of yellow taxis and ride-sharing (Lyft) from the New York City (NYC), and validated the accuracy and effectiveness of STC-GEF in fusing different transportation platform data and predicting traffic flows.},
